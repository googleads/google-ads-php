/**
 * Shopping performance view.
 * Provides Shopping campaign and Performance Max campaign statistics aggregated
 * at several product dimension levels. Product dimension values from
 * Merchant Center such as brand, category, custom attributes, product
 * condition, and product type will reflect the state of each dimension as of
 * the date and time when the corresponding event was recorded.
 * The number of impressions and clicks that `shopping_performance_view`
 * returns stats for may be different from campaign reports.
 * `shopping_performance_view` shows impressions and clicks on products
 * appearing in ads, while campaign reports show impressions and clicks on the
 *  ads themselves. Depending on the format, an ad can show from zero to several
 * products, so the numbers may not match.
 * In Google Ads UI, you can query impressions and clicks of products
 * appearing in ads by selecting a column from "Product attributes" in the
 * report editor. For example, selecting the "Brand" column is equivalent to
 * selecting `segments.product_brand`.
