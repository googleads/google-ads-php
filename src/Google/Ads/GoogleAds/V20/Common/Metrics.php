     *     @type int|string $cost_of_goods_sold_micros
     *           Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the total cost of the products you sold in
     *           orders attributed to your ads.
     *           How it works: You can add a cost of goods sold value to every product in
     *           Merchant Center. If you report conversions with cart data, the products you
     *           sold are matched with their cost of goods sold value and this can be used
     *           to calculate the gross profit you made on each order.
     *           Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a hat then bought the same
     *           hat and a shirt. The hat has a cost of goods sold value of $3, the shirt
     *           has a cost of goods sold value of $5. The cost of goods sold for this order
     *           is $8 = $3 + $5.
     *           This metric is only available if you report conversions with cart data.
     *     @type int|string $gross_profit_micros
     *           Gross profit is the profit you made from orders attributed to your ads
     *           minus the cost of goods sold (COGS).
     *           How it works: Gross profit is the revenue you made from sales attributed to
     *           your ads minus cost of goods sold. Gross profit calculations only include
     *           products that have a cost of goods sold value in Merchant Center.
     *           Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a hat then bought the same
     *           hat and a shirt in an order from your website. The hat is priced $10 and
     *           the shirt is priced $20. The hat has a cost of goods sold value of $3, but
     *           the shirt has no cost of goods sold value. Gross profit for this order will
     *           only take into account the hat, so it's $7 = $10 - $3.
     *           This metric is only available if you report conversions with cart data.
     *     @type float $gross_profit_margin
     *           Gross profit margin is the percentage gross profit you made from orders
     *           attributed to your ads, after taking out the cost of goods sold (COGS).
     *           How it works: You report conversions with cart data for completed purchases
     *           on your website. Gross profit margin is the gross profit you made divided
     *           by your total revenue and multiplied by 100%. Gross profit margin
     *           calculations only include products that have a cost of goods sold value in
     *           Merchant Center.
     *           Example: Someone bought a hat and a shirt in an order on your website. The
     *           hat is priced $10 and has a cost of goods sold value of $3. The shirt is
     *           priced $20 but has no cost of goods sold value. Gross profit margin for
     *           this order will only take into account the hat because it has a cost of
     *           goods sold value, so it's 70% = ($10 - $3)/$10 x 100%.
     *           This metric is only available if you report conversions with cart data.
     *     @type int|string $revenue_micros

     *           How it works: You report conversions with cart data for completed purchases
     *           on your website. Revenue is the total value of all the orders you received
     *           attributed to your ads, minus any discount.
     *           Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad  for a hat then bought the same
     *           hat and a shirt in an order from your website. The hat is priced $10 and
     *           the shirt is priced $20. The entire order has a $5 discount. The revenue
     *           from this order is $25 = ($10 + $20) - $5.

     *           on your website. Units sold is the total number of products sold from all
     *           orders attributed to your ads.

     *           How it works: You report conversions with cart data for completed purchases
